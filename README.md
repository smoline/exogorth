* This is a command line tool
* Run this program by typing ruby alderaan.rb
* When you start the program you are presented with a list of Star Wars movie titles and asked to choose one
* After a title is selected the user is presented with the opening crawl for the movie and asked if they would like to learn more or select another title.
* If they choose to select another title, they go back to the list.
* If they wish to learn more, they get a list of characters presented.
* If they choose one of of the characters, they can read a character bio and are asked if they'd like to go back to the movie or to select another title.

* Planned updates for this program:
  * Handle the API requests themselves through class methods in the relevant classes.
  * Convert the application to a Sinatra application that presents the same information via HTML and gets the same information via forms.
